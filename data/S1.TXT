Players Guide

So follow our little friend with his needle
through 99 very different landscapes
where he has to collect certain items.
They are almost hidden in a bunch of balloons.
You`ll have to prick these balloons to
find out whether there are items in.
#
After having collected the necessary amount
shown in the bottom menu, an exit to the next
level will show up.

But ... there are dangers, too!
Face them or try to stay away from them.
#
Of course, some levels do have timelimits.
If you run out of time before you reach the
exit, you will loose one of the three lives
you got when you started the game.

Good players are allowed to enter their name
into our Top-Ten highscore table.
#
